Cats do that because they regard their owners as their \"kittens.\" The cats are teaching their \"kittens\" how to hunt by bringing them food. Most people aren\u0027t too delighted when a pet brings in their kill. Instead of punishing your cat, praise it for its efforts, accept the prey, and then secretly throw it away.",
